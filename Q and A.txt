GIT REPOSITORY URL:

1. Can I use a wildcard (ie. :word) in a form action?
  A: No. I need to interpolate if I want a value to be passed as part of the URL to the next page.

2. If I have multiple checkboxes in a form and none are checked, what value do I get?
  A: None, not even nil. The key isn't even entered in the params hash.

3. If I have multiple checkboxes and they are all checked, what value do I get?
  A: The value of the last checkbox.

4. If radio buttons are left unchecked when a page loads and then the form is submitted, what is the return value?

5. Is the convention in ERB to interpolate Ruby into HTML or use Ruby to write the HTML?
